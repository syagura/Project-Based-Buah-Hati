Other  Factors
1.  Physical  Activity:  Children  who  are  more  physically  active  need  more  calories  
and  nutrients  to  support  their  activity  levels.
2.  Health  Conditions:  Children  with  certain  health  conditions,  such  as  food  allergies  
or  digestive  disorders,  may  require  special  diets  or  supplements.
3.  Genetics  and  Environment:  Genetic  factors  can  influence  a  child's  nutritional  
needs  and  growth.  Environment  such  as  sun  exposure  also  affects  
vitamin  D  needs.
•  Head  Circumference:  Growth  in  head  circumference  reflects  brain  development.
Adequate  nutrition,  especially  essential  fats  and  iron,  is  essential  for  optimal  
brain  development.
•  Height:  Taller  children  may  require  more  nutrients  to  support  bone  and  tissue  
growth.
•  Body  Weight:  Calorie  and  nutrient  requirements  increase  as  a  child's  weight  
increases.  Heavier  children  need  more  calories  to  support  growth  and  
physical  activity.
Providing  proper  nutrition  to  children  aged  0-60  months  is  very  important  to  support  
optimal  growth  and  development.  Parents  and  caregivers  must  pay  attention  to  meeting  
energy,  macronutrient  and  micronutrient  needs  according  to  age,  weight,  height,  head  
circumference  and  other  factors.  Breast  milk  remains  the  main  source  of  nutrition  in  
the  first  six  months  of  life,  and  nutrient-rich  complementary  foods  should  be  introduced  
gradually  starting  at  six  months  of  age.
Conclusion
It  is  important  for  parents  to  consult  with  a  nutritionist  or  pediatrician  to  ensure  
that  their  child's  nutritional  needs  are  properly  met.

During  adolescence  (9-18  years),  boys  and  girls  experience  very  rapid  growth,  especially  during  puberty.  
Females  generally  grow  2-8  inches  (5-20  cm)  and  males  grow  4-12  inches  (10-30  cm).  Energy  
requirements  increase  to  support  the  growth  of  bones,  muscles  and  fat  tissue.  Required  
nutrients  include  a  higher  number  of  calories,  as  well  as  protein,  iron,  calcium,  and  vitamin  D  to  
support  bone  and  muscle  growthÿ8:4†sourceÿÿ8:5†sourceÿ.
In  general,  all  of  these  stages  of  development  require  a  balanced  diet  with  proper  nutritional  
intake  to  ensure  optimal  growth  and  development.
Head  circumference,  height  and  weight  are  used  as  the  main  indicators  to  monitor  whether  
children  are  getting  enough  nutrition  and  growing  according  to  the  growth  standards  set  by  WHO
ÿ8:0†sourceÿÿ8:2†sourceÿ.
Nutritional  needs  for  children  vary  significantly  based  on  their  height,  weight,  head  
circumference,  gender,  and  age.  These  factors  influence  the  required  intake  of  macronutrients  and  
micronutrients  to  support  optimal  growth  and  development.  Below  is  a  detailed  overview  of  the  nutritional  
requirements  for  children  segmented  by  different  stages  of  growth.
8:1†sourceÿ.
Children  ages  4-8  years  need  about  1,200  to  1,800  calories  per  day  for  girls,  and  1,200  to  
2,000  calories  per  day  for  boys,  depending  on  their  activity  level.  At  this  age,  children  grow  about  
2-3  inches  (5-7  cm)  and  gain  4.5-6.5  pounds  (2-3  kg)  per  year.  Important  nutrients  include  
carbohydrates  (45-65%  of  total  calories),  protein  (10-30%  of  total  calories),  and  fat  (25-35%  of  total  
calories).  Fiber  is  also  important  with  daily  requirements  of  around  17-25  gramsÿ8:2†sourceÿ.
The  nutrients  needed  by  children  vary  based  on  height,  weight,  head  circumference,  gender  and  
age.  During  infancy  (0-1  year),  the  body  experiences  rapid  growth  where  height  increases  by  
50%  and  body  weight  can  be  three  times  the  birth  weight.  Head  circumference  is  also  an  important  
measurement  for  assessing  brain  development.  The  nutrients  needed  include  high  levels  of  energy  
and  protein,  as  well  as  various  micronutrients  that  support  cell  growth  and  brain  development.  
Babies  at  this  age  are  very  dependent  on  breast  milk  or  formula  milk  as  the  main  source  of  nutrition
ÿ8:0†sourceÿÿ
Meeting  the  nutritional  needs  of  children  aged  0-60  months  is  very  important  to  ensure  optimal  
growth  and  development.  Breast  milk  provides  most  of  a  baby's  nutritional  needs  up  to  6  months  of  
age,  after  which  MPASI  needs  to  be  introduced.  Monitoring  children's  physical  development  
and  health  as  well  as  educating  parents  about  healthy  eating  patterns  is  very  important  to  support  
children's  nutritional  needs.
###  Infancy  (Birth  to  1  Year)

8:4†sourceÿ.
Growth  charts  are  used  to  monitor  development,  ensuring  that  weight,  height,  and  head  
circumference  follow  standard  percentiles.  Nutritional  requirements  remain  high  on  a  per-kilogram  
basis  but  decrease  slightly  compared  to  infancy.  Key  nutrients  include  protein  for  muscle  
development,  fats  for  brain  growth,  and  carbohydrates  for  energyÿ8:0†sourceÿ.
Toddlers  continue  to  experience  rapid  growth,  although  at  a  slower  rate  compared  to  infancy.
8:0†sourceÿÿ8:4†sourceÿ.
At  this  stage,  children  experience  steady  but  slower  growth.  Nutritional  needs  begin  to  align  more  
closely  with  those  of  older  children,  although  still  relatively  high  per  kilogram  of  body  weight.
During  infancy,  rapid  growth  requires  a  high  intake  of  macronutrients  and  micronutrients  per  
kilogram  of  body  weight.  Energy  needs  are  substantial  due  to  rapid  cell  division  and  metabolic  rates  
that  are  twice  those  of  adults.  For  infants  up  to  six  months  old,  breast  milk  is  the  optimal  source  of  
nutrition,  providing  all  necessary  nutrients  without  additional  water,  even  in  hot  climates.  The  
frequency  of  breastfeeding  typically  ranges  from  eight  to  twelve  times  per  dayÿ
###  Preschoolers  (3  to  5  Years)
Toddlers  need  a  balanced  diet  incorporating  all  food  groups.  High  iron  foods  like  lean  meats  and  iron-
fortified  cereals  are  crucial  to  preventing  anemia.  Adequate  intake  of  fruits  and  vegetables  ensures  
sufficient  vitamins  and  minerals.  Milk  and  dairy  products  remain  important  for  calcium  and  vitamin  D  to  
support  bone  growthÿ8:0†sourceÿÿ8:1†sourceÿ.
These  should  be  nutrient-dense,  including  baby  meats,  vegetables,  fruits,  and  dairy  products  like  
yogurt,  but  not  infant  formula  which  serves  as  a  substitute  for  breast  milk.  The  World  Health  Organization  
recommends  continued  breastfeeding  up  to  two  years  of  age  or  beyondÿ
Carbohydrates  should  make  up  45-65%  of  daily  intake,  proteins  10-30%,  and  fats  25-35%ÿ
Complementary  foods  are  introduced  around  six  months  to  meet  increasing  nutrient  demands.
Preschoolers  require  about  1,200  to  1,600  calories  per  day,  depending  on  their  activity  level.
###  Toddlers  (1  to  3  Years)
8:1†sourceÿ.
Iron,  calcium,  and  vitamins  A  and  C  are  particularly  important.  Foods  should  be  nutrient-dense,  including  
a  variety  of  fruits,  vegetables,  whole  grains,  and  lean  proteins.  It's  also  crucial  to  limit  sugar  and  
saturated  fat  intake  to  prevent  early  onset  of  obesityÿ8:2†sourceÿ.

###  Adolescents  (13  to  18  Years)
Adolescence  is  marked  by  puberty  and  rapid  growth  spurts,  leading  to  increased  nutritional  
requirements.  Energy  needs  can  range  from  2,200  to  3,200  calories  per  day  for  boys  and  1,800  to  
2,400  calories  per  day  for  girls,  depending  on  activity  levels.  Protein  intake  is  crucial  to  support  
the  growth  of  muscle  mass,  while  fats  and  carbohydrates  provide  necessary  energyÿ
8:2†sourceÿ.
Physicians  use  growth  charts  to  monitor  children's  growth  trends.  These  charts  help  identify  potential  
nutritional  deficiencies  or  excesses  that  may  require  dietary  adjustments.  Rapid  weight  gain  might  
indicate  a  risk  for  obesity,  while  insufficient  growth  could  signal  malnutrition  or  other  health  issues.  
Regular  assessments  ensure  children  receive  the  necessary  nutrients  to  support  their  development  at  
each  stageÿ8:0†sourceÿÿ8:1†sourceÿ.
School-aged  children  need  balanced  diets  with  appropriate  portions  from  all  food  groups.  Key  
macronutrients  include  carbohydrates  (45-65%  of  daily  calories),  proteins  (10-30%),  and  fats  
(25-35%).  High  fiber  foods  are  essential  to  support  digestive  health.  Iron  and  calcium  continue  to  be  
critical,  especially  for  bone  development  and  the  prevention  of  iron  deficiencyÿ
8:2†sourceÿ.
Growth  during  the  school  years  continues  at  a  consistent  pace,  with  an  average  annual  increase  of  2-3  
inches  in  height  and  4.5-6.5  pounds  in  weight.  Energy  needs  vary  with  activity  levels  but  generally  
range  from  1,200  to  2,200  calories  per  day,  with  boys  typically  requiring  more  calories  than  girls
ÿ8:1†sourceÿÿ8:2†sourceÿ.
###  School-Aged  Children  (6  to  12  Years)
Iron  needs  also  increase,  especially  for  girls  due  to  menstruation.  A  balanced  diet  rich  in  fruits,  
vegetables,  whole  grains,  and  lean  proteins  is  essential  to  meet  these  increased  demands  and  support  
overall  healthÿ8:2†sourceÿ.
Calcium  and  vitamin  D  are  particularly  important  to  support  the  rapid  increase  in  bone  density.

The  nutritional  needs  of  children  vary  significantly  based  on  their  age,  gender,  height,  weight,  and  
head  circumference.  These  factors  influence  the  type  and  amount  of  nutrients  required  to  support  their  
growth  and  development.  Here's  a  detailed  overview  of  these  needs:
-  **Proteins**:  Crucial  for  muscle  growth  and  development,  children  need  10-30%  of  theirs
Adequate  intake  of  calcium  and  vitamin  D  is  necessary,  and  children  not  getting  enough  vitamin  D  from  
their  diet  should  take  a  10  microgram  (400  IU)  supplement  dailyÿ8:0†sourceÿÿ
-  **Carbohydrates**:  Essential  for  providing  energy,  the  Acceptable  Macronutrient  Distribution  Range  
(AMDR)  for  carbohydrates  is  45-65%  of  daily  calories.  For  a  daily  intake  of  1,200  calories,  this  equates  
to  135-195  grams.  High-fiber  carbohydrates  are  particularly  important.
