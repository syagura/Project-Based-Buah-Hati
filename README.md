This project utilizes TensorFlow.js and Prometheus Engineering Gemini to predict child growth and provide nutrition recommendations using Google Cloud API.

## Overview

This application aims to predict the growth of children based on historical data using machine learning models built with TensorFlow.js. It incorporates the Prometheus Engineering Gemini platform to manage data and provide insights. The predictions and recommendations for nutrition are powered by Google Cloud APIs.

## Features

- **TensorFlow.js Model**: Trained machine learning models deployed using TensorFlow.js for predicting child growth patterns.
- **Prometheus Engineering Gemini Integration**: Integration with Prometheus Engineering Gemini platform for data management and analytics.
- **Google Cloud API**: Utilizes Google Cloud API for generating nutrition recommendations based on predicted growth patterns.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations of growth predictions and nutritional recommendations for easy understanding.

## Installation
